## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import pandas as pd
# Define column names.
cols = [
 'integercolumn',
 'stringcolumn'
 ]
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is primarily for Go programmers who want to become a machine learning engineer and to build a solid machine learning mindset along with a good hold on Go packages. This is also useful for data analysts, data engineers, machine learning users who want to run their machine learning experiments using the Go ecosystem. Prior understanding of linear algebra is required to benefit from this book

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).
